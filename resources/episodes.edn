             {:number "2" :youtube "zIajwJDi4wY" :date "2015-08-18" :name "Frontal Assault" :description "In this one, we create most of the front-end code. We take a look at the data structure that describes the game, using that to build up our UI."}
             {:number "3" :youtube "7Q4-BYOQZXg" :date "2015-08-21" :name "What Lies Beneath" :description "The player has only one action available; revealing a tile. We'll start implementing the central `reveal-tile` function on the backend, writing tests along the way."}
             {:number "4" :youtube "Z6CHO6PI2BY" :date "2015-08-28" :name "Waking the Dead" :description "Matching a pair of certain tiles, like zombies and fog, has adverse effects. We continue working on the core game logic."}
             {:number "5" :youtube "VtzcESnMZDo" :date "2015-09-03" :name "Re-animated" :description "We've created the UI rendering code, and we've made some progress on the backend game logic. It's time to wake up the beast, connecting the client and the server through web sockets."}
             {:number "6" :youtube "j8oOw56ZGEw" :date "2015-09-11" :name "Quickly, hide!" :description "We can now reveal tiles, but they're never turned back. We'll have to keep track of time somehow, so the player gets a chance to see the tiles before they're concealed again."}]}]
